**Project Title**:
Comparison of various Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches for the Classification of Epileptic Seizures From EEG Signals        

**Objective**:
The objective of this work is to compare and evaluate the performance of various machine learning and deep learning approaches for the classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals. The aim is to identify the most effective method for accurately and efficiently classifying epileptic seizures, which could have important applications in clinical settings for diagnosing and treating epilepsy.

**Background**:
Epilepsy is a neurological disorder that affects approximately 50 million people worldwide. It is characterized by recurrent seizures, which are abnormal electrical activities in the brain. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are commonly used for the diagnosis and monitoring of epilepsy. Machine learning and deep learning approaches have shown promising results in the classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals. In this study, we aim to compare various machine learning and deep learning approaches for the classification of epileptic seizures from EEG signals. We will evaluate the performance of these approaches using various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). This work is important as accurate classification of epileptic seizures can aid in the diagnosis and treatment of epilepsy.

**Methodology**:
The methodology for this work involves the following steps:

Data collection: EEG signals from patients with epilepsy are collected using standard clinical procedures.
Preprocessing: The EEG signals are preprocessed to remove artifacts, filter noise, and segment the data into relevant time windows.
Feature extraction: Various features are extracted from the preprocessed EEG signals to represent the underlying dynamics of the brain activity.
Model selection: Several machine learning and deep learning models are evaluated for their performance in classifying epileptic seizures from EEG signals.
Training and testing: The selected models are trained on a subset of the data and tested on a separate validation set to evaluate their accuracy and generalization performance.
Performance evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score.
Comparison and analysis: The results of the different models are compared and analyzed to identify the most effective approach for classifying epileptic seizures from EEG signals.

**Deliverables**:
* A GitHub repository containing the workflow and documentation of the project.
* An oral presentation in class.

**Dataset to be used**:
The dataset used in our work is taken from the publicly available database of department of epileptology from university of Bonn, Germany. The Dataset is comprised of five groups, namely A to E, each group contains 100 single-channel EEG signals, and each signal is of 23.6-sec in length with 4097 examples.
